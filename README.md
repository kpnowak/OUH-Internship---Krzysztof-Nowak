In this repository, you will be able to find my whole research about "Multi-omics data fusion optimization using intermediate integration techniques"

It is a part of my Bachelor's Thesis and Internship at the Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital where PhD candidate Alberto López Sánchez is my supervisor.


*How to run the algorithms?*

Run the following command in your terminal to create the environment:
conda env create -f environment.yml

OR

To install all packages, you can use the following command in your terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt

*Open final_algorithm.py and run it to compute Task 1*

In the old1_algorithmoutput you can find first algorithms written for the purpuse of first task
In the old2_algorithmoutput you can find second algorithms and combination of the first ones written for the purpuse of first task
